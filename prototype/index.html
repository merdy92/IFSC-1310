<h2>University of Arkansas at Little Rock: A Brief History</h2>

<p>The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) is a public research university in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as Little Rock Junior College by the Little Rock School District in 1927, the institution became a private four-year university under the name Little Rock University in 1957. It returned to public status in 1969 when it merged with the University of Arkansas System under its present name. The former campus of Little Rock Junior College is now (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.</p>

<h3>Campus living</h3>

UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has four residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and the University Village Apartment Complex[21] on the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.

<h3>Athletics</h3>

UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:
<ul>
<li>Baseball</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
<li>Women's Volleyball</li>
<li>Women's Soccer</li>
<li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
<li>Men's wrestling</li>
</ul>
Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.

Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.
